# Assets feature

Where the household's money/assets sit, and their current value. The valuation maths live in [[asset-valuation]]; this file covers the CRUD/summary flow.

## Overview

CRUD over `Asset`, with a derived current value. On create, `valuationMode` defaults from the asset type (see [[asset-valuation]]).

## Rules / flow

- **Discriminated form**: visible fields switch on the selected type's valuation mode. Per-mode conditional validation via `.superRefine`:
  - `manual` → requires `value`.
  - `market_priced` → requires `symbol` + `quantity ≥ 0` + `unitPrice` (user-entered price of 1 unit; see [[asset-valuation]]).
  - `formula_calculated` → requires `principal` + `interestRate ≥ 0` + `startDate`.
- `toAsset()` converts raw form → typed `Asset`, returning `null` on incomplete inputs. `fromAsset()` does the reverse (seed the form for **edit**).
- **Edit / create share one form** (frontend-web): the same discriminated `AssetFormDialog`; edit re-seeds via `fromAsset` and PATCHes. Rows have an Edit/Delete actions menu.
- **Liquidity summary**: assets are grouped/summed into 3 buckets — "Có thể dùng ngay" (`usable_now`), "Tiết kiệm & dự phòng" (`not_immediately_usable`), "Dài hạn" (`long_term`). `snapshotTotal` = sum of the three (`computeLiquidityTotals` on backend).
- **Delete** = soft-delete (`deletedAt`) + also delete the asset's valuations + unlink the asset from any money events.
- **Status / lifecycle**: `status` (`active` | `sold` | `closed`, default `active`) + `soldAt`. Distinct from `deletedAt`: a **sold** asset is kept (quantity/value 0) for history, excluded from the liquidity buckets and net worth, but still listed (with a "Đã bán" badge; the list dropdown shows a "Bán" action for sellable, still-active assets). Selling is driven by an `asset_sale` money event — see [[asset-sale]].

## Sub-entities (backend)

- `AssetMarketPosition` — symbol / quantity / quoteCurrency / lastPrice (for market-priced).
- `AssetCalculationTerm` — principal / rate / dates / compounding (for formula-based interest instruments).
- `AssetValuation` — point-in-time value with method/confidence; optionally linked to a market price, FX rate, or calc term.

## Where it lives in code

- **frontend-web**: `src/features/assets/{model/assets.ts, model/assets.types.ts, model/assets-form.ts, api/assets.repository.ts, hooks/use-assets.ts, hooks/use-assets-page.ts}`.
- **backend**: `src/modules/assets/` (`assets.service.ts`, `entities/{asset,asset-valuation,calculation-term,market-position}.entity.ts`, `repositories/prisma-assets.repository.ts`).
- **mobile-app**: to be ported.

## Enums

`AssetType` (15), `ValuationMode`, `AssetLiquidity`, `AssetClass`, `CalculationType = saving_deposit | bond | loan_receivable | certificate_of_deposit`.
